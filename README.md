Virtual Table Top for Role Playing games (web based)

Created by Aaron Auseth

This is a proof of concept at the moment.  My goal is to reproduce (reverse engineer) [Maptools](https://www.rptools.net/) as a web client.  I' aware that [Maptools is opensource](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool) and built in Java.

Along the way I'd like to incorporate some of the features of [Roll20](https://roll20.net/) and [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/).  Stretch goal of reworking the macro language to be javascript-ish.

This is a good opportunity for me to improve my programming skills and learn the latest web frameworks and workflows (VUE, GitHut, AWS, ECMAScript 6, etc).

I started this back in Dec of 2015 with occasional [videos of my progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo4vkIncoBQ&list=PL4zL3-Vf2uUT7Y7HlnOTZIHBMs6a7ZYpz).  I shelved the project as I was playing 2 dungeon & dragons games and game mastering one game.  Thanks to COVID19 I resurected this project.
